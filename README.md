            ## Description

            A user-driven automated READme.md generator using Inquirer NPM, File System (FS), and Node.js to create markdown files.

            ## Installation

            This application requires installation of Node.js. Users will also need access to a coding application/environment such as Visual Code with access to GitBash/terminal to run Node. Inquirer npm is also required. This can be done by running "npm init", with either " -y" after, or if not, manually submit your values. Then installation is done by running "npm i inquirer", which installs the npm and all required dependencies.

            ## Usage

            To use this READmeGenerator, run "Node index.js" in the terminal, answering each prompt. After all prompts have been answered, a new README.md will be generated, which can be opened and previewed with "CTRL+Shift+V"(on Windows).
